# Debate-Prep - Phase 1 Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the first phase implementation of Debate-Prep, a Windows-first, moderator-controlled, multi-agent debate sandbox application built with WinUI 3 and .NET 8.

## What's Been Implemented

### ✅ Core Infrastructure
- **Project Structure**: Clean separation between UI (`DebatePrep`), Core Logic (`DebatePrep.Core`), and Tests (`DebatePrep.Tests`)
- **Database Layer**: SQLite-based persistence with proper schema and migrations
- **Data Models**: Complete entity models for Sessions, Participants, Turns, and Critique Rules
- **Testing Framework**: Unit tests with golden file support structure

### ✅ Core Services

#### SessionService
- Create and manage debate sessions
- Add participants with personas (position, constraints, disallowed behaviors)
- Record turns and manage the debate transcript
- Rate turns with thumbs up/down and downvote reasons

#### ConfigurationService
- Encrypted API key storage using Windows DPAPI
- Model provider and generation parameter management
- Secure configuration persistence

#### ExportService
- Export sessions to Markdown, HTML, and Plain Text formats
- Metadata ordering as specified in PRD Appendix E.4
- Support for archived participants in exports
- UTF-8 encoding with proper timestamp formatting

#### CritiqueMemoryService
- ML.NET-powered similarity detection for critique rules
- Cosine similarity threshold (≥0.80) for rule merging
- Upvote decay system (-0.02 for unused rules)
- Deterministic floating-point operations (2-decimal precision)

### ✅ Provider Abstraction
- **IModelProvider Interface**: Clean abstraction for AI model providers
- **HuggingFaceProvider**: Implementation for Hugging Face Inference API
- **Streaming Support**: Async enumerable token chunks
- **Usage Tracking**: Optional cost and token usage reporting

### ✅ WinUI 3 Application Shell
- Modern Windows UI with proper theming
- Responsive layout with session/participant panel and transcript view
- Moderator controls for turn management
- Status bar with provider information
- Accessibility-ready with proper tab order and keyboard navigation

## Architecture

```
DebatePrep (WinUI 3 App)
├── MainWindow.xaml - Main application window
├── App.xaml - Application entry point
└── (ViewModels and additional views to be added in Phase 2)

DebatePrep.Core (Business Logic)
├── Models/ - Data entities (Session, Participant, Turn, etc.)
├── Data/ - Database context and migrations
├── Services/ - Business logic services
├── Providers/ - AI model provider abstractions
└── (Additional services for turn generation, prompt engineering)

DebatePrep.Tests (Unit Tests)
├── SessionServiceTests.cs - Core functionality tests
└── Golden/ - Reference files for regression testing
    ├── exports/ - Sample export formats
    └── logs/ - Sample log formats
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Moderator-Controlled Turns**
- No automatic rounds - moderator explicitly selects who speaks next
- Turn rating system with constructive feedback loops
- Critique memory that learns from downvotes

### 2. **Persistent Sessions**
- Local SQLite storage with no cloud dependencies
- Session, participant, and turn data properly normalized
- Support for participant archiving

### 3. **Critique Memory System**
- ML.NET-based text similarity detection
- Rule merging when similar critiques are provided
- Strength-based rule prioritization with decay
- Deterministic algorithms as specified in PRD

### 4. **Export Functionality**
- Multiple format support (MD/HTML/TXT)
- Proper metadata ordering and timestamp formatting
- Archived participant handling in exports
- UTF-8 encoding with LF line endings

### 5. **Secure Configuration**
- Windows DPAPI encryption for API keys
- Provider-agnostic configuration system
- Generation parameter management

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests with a focus on:
- Session management operations
- Database schema validation
- Service layer functionality
- Golden file regression testing structure

Run tests with:
```bash
dotnet test tests/DebatePrep.Tests/DebatePrep.Tests.csproj
```

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK
- Windows 10 version 1903 (build 18362) or later
- Visual Studio 2022 with Windows App SDK workload (recommended)

### Build
```bash
dotnet build DebatePrep.sln
```

### Run
```bash
dotnet run --project src/DebatePrep/DebatePrep.csproj
```

## Next Phase Priorities

### Phase 2 - Core Functionality
1. **Turn Generation System**: Implement the actual AI-powered debate turn generation
2. **MVVM Implementation**: Add ViewModels and proper data binding
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Build the context-aware prompt system with critique guidance
4. **Session Management UI**: Complete the session creation and management interface
5. **Real-time Streaming**: Implement streaming token display during generation

### Phase 3 - Polish and Features
1. **Asset Creation**: Add proper application icons and branding
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback
3. **Performance Optimization**: Token budgeting and memory management
4. **Additional Providers**: Ollama integration and provider extensibility
5. **Advanced Export**: PDF export capability

## Technical Debt and Improvements

1. **Asset Files**: Currently removed to enable building - need proper icons
2. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling implemented - needs comprehensive coverage
3. **Logging**: Structure in place but needs full implementation
4. **UI Polish**: Basic layout implemented - needs styling and animations
5. **Platform Warnings**: DPAPI usage generates platform warnings (expected for Windows-first app)

## Compliance with PRD

This Phase 1 implementation follows the PRD specifications including:
- ✅ Deterministic algorithms with 2-decimal precision
- ✅ Fixed metadata ordering in exports
- ✅ ML.NET implementation for critique memory
- ✅ SQLite schema as specified
- ✅ Windows DPAPI for key encryption
- ✅ UTF-8 encoding with LF newlines
- ✅ Token chunk interface as defined

The implementation provides a solid foundation for the remaining phases while maintaining strict adherence to the architectural and technical requirements outlined in the PRD.
