# Debate-Prep

Moderator-controlled multi-agent debate app for structured practice and analysis. Create personas, control who speaks next, rate responses, and export transcripts. Built for Windows-only desktop with .NET 8 + WinUI 3. Open-sourced by Columbia Cloudworks LLC under the MIT license.

## Features

- Custom AI participants with persistent personas and critique memory
- Streaming responses with token/cost estimates

## Tech Stack

- Shell/UI: Windows App SDK (WinUI 3, .NET 8)
