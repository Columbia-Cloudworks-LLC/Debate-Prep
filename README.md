# Debate-Prep

Moderator-controlled multi-agent debate app for structured practice and analysis. Create personas, control who speaks next, rate responses, and export transcripts. Built for Windows-first desktop with Rust + Tauri and a React UI. Open-sourced by Columbia Cloudworks LLC under the MIT license.

## Features

- Moderator decides who speaks next; no automatic rounds
- Custom AI participants with persistent personas and critique memory
- Streaming responses with token/cost estimates
- Local persistence (SQLite); exports to Markdown/HTML/TXT
- Secure key storage (Windows DPAPI; OS keyring elsewhere)

## Tech Stack

- Shell: Tauri (Rust backend + WebView)
- UI: React + Vite + TypeScript
- Backend: Rust (Tokio, Reqwest, Serde, Rusqlite)
- Providers: Hugging Face (v1), Ollama (planned)

## Getting Started (development)

Prerequisites:
